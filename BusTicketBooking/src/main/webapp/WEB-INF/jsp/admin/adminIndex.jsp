<div class="d-flex w-75 justify-content-end">
    <p>We’ve already featured a somewhat similar Bootstrap sidebar above (Colorlib Sidebar V01), but there’s a FEATURE that differentiates the two slightly. 
    For some, it’s a big change because this is the exact sidebar they are after.
    While Colorlib Sidebar V08 comes with a dropdown, it does not feature the number of posts, followers and following.
    What’s more, it’s completely harmonious with smartphones, tablets, and desktops.</p>
